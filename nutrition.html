    <h2>Nutrition</h2>
    <p><b>Balanced Diet:</b> Emphasize the importance of a balanced diet that includes a variety of nutrient-rich foods, such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats. Encourage portion control to maintain a healthy weight.</p>

        <p><b>Fruits and Vegetables:</b> Highlight the benefits of consuming a wide range of colorful fruits and vegetables, as they are rich in vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. Encourage individuals to aim for at least 5 servings per day.</p>
        
        <p><b>Whole Grains:</b> Recommend incorporating whole grains like brown rice, quinoa, whole wheat bread, and oats into meals. Whole grains are a good source of fiber and can support heart health.</p>
        
        <p><b>Lean Proteins:</b> Encourage the inclusion of lean protein sources such as poultry, fish, legumes, and tofu. They provide essential amino acids and support muscle growth and repair.</p>
        
        <p><b>Healthy Fats:</b> Educate about the importance of choosing healthy fats like avocados, nuts, seeds, and olive oil. These fats can help support heart health when consumed in moderation.</p>
        
        <p><b>Limit Sodium and Added Sugars:</b> Advise reducing the intake of sodium and foods high in added sugars, as excessive consumption can increase the risk of heart disease and other health issues.</p>
        
        <p><b>Hydration:</b> Promote the importance of staying hydrated by drinking an adequate amount of water throughout the day. Encourage individuals to limit sugary drinks and opt for water as the primary beverage.</p>
