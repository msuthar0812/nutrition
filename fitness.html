    <h2>Fitness Tips</h2>
    <p><b>Focus on Progressive Overload:</b> Gradually increase the intensity, weight, or repetitions of your exercises over time to challenge your muscles and stimulate growth. This can be achieved through resistance training, such as weightlifting.</p>

        <p><b>Consume Sufficient Calories:</b> To bulk and build muscle, ensure you're consuming a calorie surplus. Include nutrient-dense foods like lean proteins, whole grains, fruits, and vegetables in your diet to support muscle growth and recovery.</p>
        
        <p><b>Prioritize Protein Intake:</b> Protein is essential for muscle repair and growth. Aim for a daily intake of 1.2-2 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight. Include sources like lean meats, poultry, fish, eggs, legumes, and dairy products.</p>
        
            <p><b>Balance Macronutrients:</b> Include an adequate amount of carbohydrates and healthy fats in your diet to provide energy for intense workouts and support overall health.</p>
        
                <p><b>Train with Compound Exercises:</b> Incorporate compound exercises like squats, deadlifts, bench presses, and pull-ups into your workout routine. These exercises engage multiple muscle groups, promoting overall strength and muscle development.</p>
        
                    <p><b>Get Sufficient Rest and Recovery:</b> Allow your body enough time to rest and recover between workout sessions. Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep each night to support muscle growth and overall well-being.</p>
